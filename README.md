# laravel-blog-app
This is a simple blog application built using Laravel. It includes user authentication, post creation, editing, and viewing features. As a beginner, I built this project to learn Laravelâ€™s MVC structure, routing, Blade templating, and Eloquent ORM. Open to feedback, suggestions, and future collaborations!
